## Description

This App reproduces the [Azure Blob Storage REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api) in AL for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. It comes with some basic UI-functionality, but of course you don't need to use these. Besides the `"AZBSA Blob Storage Connection"` table all tables are temporary.

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to create a Pull Request.

**Please note**: This is a work in progress. I can't guarantee full functionality or no errors. Please report any problems you encounter.

Start by setting up a `Blob Storage Connection`:

![Setup Card Page](./docs/screenshot-setup-card-01.png)

From there you have a couple of options, e.g. you can view which containers are available via `List all Containers`

![Container Actions](./docs/screenshot-setup-card-actions-01.png)

The result might look something like this:

![Container Result example](./docs/screenshot-list-containers.png)

If you want to check what's inside a container you can use one of the other actions:

![Container Actions](./docs/screenshot-setup-card-actions-02.png)

The result might look something like this:

![Container Content Result example](./docs/screenshot-list-container-content.png)

The other actions work similar, but of course you don't need to use this via UI - you can also just 


## Usage

In general you'll mostly need two different objects to work with the API:
- `codeunit 89001 "AZBSA Request Object"`
- `codeunit 89000 "AZBSA Blob Storage API"`

The `codeunit 89001 "AZBSA Request Object"` contains all information relevant for a request. There are multiple overloads for "InitializeRequest", depending on what you need to do. The only parameter relevant for all requests is "Storage Account Name" (and the "Authorization"-information). So before any API-call you need to call `InitializeAuthorization` and `InitializeRequest` and you're ready to go.

All API-methods are publicly available in `codeunit 89000 "AZBSA Blob Storage API"`.


### Sample Code

Check out the procedures in `table 89000 "AZBSA Blob Storage Connection"` to see examples for the usage. Below you can find a simple example to create a Container in a Storage Account:

```
local procedure CreateContainer(ContainerName: Text)
var
    API: Codeunit "AZBSA Blob Storage API";
    RequestObject: Codeunit "AZBSA Request Object";
    AuthType: Enum "AZBSA Authorization Type";
begin
    RequestObject.InitializeAuthorization(AuthType::SharedKey, '02ruoBoh....jjwgooov49oMA==');
    RequestObject.InitializeRequest('simonofhhtest001', 'testcontainer');
    API.CreateContainer(RequestObject);
end;
```


## Authorization Methods

Azure supports multiple options to authorize requests (see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-requests-to-azure-storage)). The App supports the following right now:

Option | Status | Description 
--- | --- | --- 
Shared Key (Storage Account Key) | ✓ | Use one of the keys you can find under "Settings" --> "Access keys" in the Azure portal for your Storage Account (or via [`Get-AzStorageAccountKey`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageaccountkey?view=azps-5.0.0))
Shared Access Signature (SAS) | ✓ | Generate a SAS token under "Settings" --> "Shared access signature" in the Azure portal for your Storage Account (or via [`New-AzStorageAccountSASToken`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.storage/new-azstorageaccountsastoken?view=azps-5.0.0))
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) |   | tbd
Active Directory (preview) |   | not planned
